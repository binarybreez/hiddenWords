# Anonymous Feedback

An application that allows users to receive anonymous feedback and messages from anyone using a unique URL. The platform employs **Gemini AI** to suggest relevant messages and feedback based on user input. Built with **Next.js 15** and **MongoDB**, this project also ensures user security with email OTP verification, password encryption, and user login through **NextAuth**.

**Currently deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**.

git clone https://github.com/binarybreez/Anonymous-Message.git
cd anonymous-feedback
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Youâ€™ll need to set up a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Your NextAuth Secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_API_KEY=<Your Resend API Key>
```
Replace `<Your MongoDB URI>`, `<Your NextAuth Secret>`, and `<Your Resend API Key>` with your actual values.

### 4. Run the application
After setting up the environment variables, you can start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application should now be live at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1. **Registration & Login**: Users must first register with an email and password. After registration, they will receive an OTP via email for verification. Once verified, they can log in with their credentials.
2. **Get Your Unique URL**: Upon successful login and verification, each user is assigned a unique URL. This URL can be shared publicly so that anyone can send them anonymous feedback.
3. **Receiving Feedback**: Once a user shares their unique URL, others can send messages or feedback through it. Gemini AI suggests relevant responses for better user engagement.

## Future Features

- **Better UI/UX**: We plan to improve the user interface and experience for easier navigation and a more engaging design.
- **Group Feature**: A feature to allow users to share feedback in a group setting will be added in the future.
